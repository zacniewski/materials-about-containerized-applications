The DevOps with Docker course was created by [Jami Kousa](https://github.com/jakousa) with the help of University of Helsinki's Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen osaston sovelluskehitysakatemia ([Toska](https://toska.dev)) and [numerous course attendees](https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io/graphs/contributors). This material is based on [gist by Matti Paksula](https://gist.github.com/matti/0b44eb865d70d98ffe0351fd8e6fa35d). You can help develop the course material as well.

As of 2022 the course was handed off to Matti Luukkainen the legendary creator of Full Stack Open. You can contact him on matti.luukkainen@helsinki.fi.
